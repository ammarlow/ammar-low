            Hello! I'm Ammar, a software engineer with a passion for creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
            My journey in software engineering began during my undergraduate studies when I discovered the joy of building 
            solutions that solve real-world problems.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at a startup, a corporate, and a telecommunications company. 
            My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences for a 
            variety of clients.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and constantly expanding my knowledge to stay up-to-date with 
            industry trends and best practices. When I'm not coding, you can find me snorkelling, reading self-help books, or 
            playing games.
